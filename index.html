I was very positively impressed with Taylor’s attention to detail, care, professionalism in doing this task. He had the right balance between consultation and independence that was needed for the task to be successful. Taylor also undertook … the adaptation of a graphics library from MIPS to RISC-V. Taylor worked very independently in this task, was meticulous in creating the documentation, webpage, and fixing any bugs that were discovered. We had a system of review of code, documentation, [and] repository content. Taylor was an active participant … both providing detailed feedback and taking the feedback that he received from other students very seriously. I strongly recommend Taylor for any organization."</p>

Taylor proved to be both capable and eager in engaging with this complex, interdisciplinary problem and, moreover, sought to bridge the gap between our various teams, doing the extra work to understand engineering and control aspects whilst succinctly communicating his own expertise. Ultimately, I observed him to be an instrumental component in our effort to advance our project and technology. Since the beginning, I identified him as an excellent candidate to become a leader within the team, and indeed he has stepped up to the plate to become the Software Lead within the Control Team. The future is bright for our Group with his enthusiasm and talent at the helm!”</p>

                <p>I am working with the student group UA Biomedical Technologies Development Group to design and prototype ALEX - an exoskeleton for the workplace. The purpose of our exoskeleton is to correct posture and reduce the load on the back and shoulders. The exoskeleton will be able to give users a 33% mechanical advantage, up to a full lift of 75lbs. This exoskeleton will be novel in that it will track motion and give feedback to the user to prevent repetitive and unhealthy range of motion injuries.<br><br>
                    This project has allowed me to experience working on a project through the entire design process; from initial planning, materials requirements evaluation, choosing and setting up the software stack, documentation, electrical circuit design, prototyping, and of course writing code all along the way. As a member I worked in a highly interdisciplinary environment. From computer science to business, biology, and engineers of all types – the students on our team ranged the scholarly gambit. This meant often I had to clearly express technical computing concepts to an audience without any previous exposure to these ideas. I’m proud to say that through my efforts and dedication to the vision of the project I am now the Software Team Lead for our Control and Power Team.<br><br>
                    The exoskeleton is being written in C++ using an Arduino to integrate an ODrive motor controller that we use to issue commands to our brushless DC motors. A big issue that we faced early on was the limitations innate to working with Arduinos. They certainly make learning microcontrollers easy but things such as the: limited IDE; predefined main, setup, and loop functions; and no code partitioning, meant we were in for problems in the long term. As such it was my job to find out how to get away from these restrictions and start writing custom and proper C++. I looked at many options for breaking out the Arduino compiler and bootloader while weighing which solution would be most flexible, best suit our needs, and be friendly to both - experienced CS students and newcomers to coding. We landed on the <a href="https://github.com/sudar/Arduino-Makefile">Arduino Makefile project</a>. Our Makefile would need to allow our members to get working with the exoskeleton fast and easy regardless of their operating system and thus would need to support Linux, IOS, and Windows. I noticed issues with the Arduino Makefile project for Windows and ended up making a pull request to the project to correct their documentation and make a fix to the Makefile which drives the project (and it was accepted, yay!). I gained experience working with another products API’s while writing C++ to handle calibration of the ODrive and position encoder. We are currently working on PID control and gravity compensation for the exoskeleton in C++ and incorporating all our code into an object-oriented design.<br><br>
                    This was my first experience working with microcontrollers, and it provided a nice knowledge base for the work that I did implementing a softcore on a high-end FPGA; which was for a graduate students’ project on the effect of offloading select query processing components to an FPGA.

                <p>In the summer of 2019, I had the fortune to work under J. Nelson Amaral where I aided in the conversion of materials for a course on Computer Architecture. A major project that I worked on during this time was the conversion of GLIM (Graphics LIbrary in MIPS) to GLIR (Graphics LIbrary in RISC-V).<br><br> 
                    GLIR is an open-source graphics library, written in RISC-V, which abstracts out the terminal escape sequences that are used to perform various functions such as changing display graphics and controlling cursor movement. GLIR was designed to enable beginner assembly programmers to include visual elements in their work by allowing production of graphical assembly programs.<br><br>
                    Working on this project was a good experience in taking an existing project and needing to really understand it, without being able to consult anyone, in order to redevelop it. The conversion required me to understand both MIPS and RISC-V assembly – the intricacies of both ISA’s, how they were related and how they differed. While converting the instructions of GLIM I wrote extensive testing programs to be sure my work remained accurate. Using these testing programs, I discovered and debugged several issues that existed in GLIM.<br><br> 
                    My work wasn’t merely only a conversion. I expanded GLIR by reworking labels to avoid any namespacing issues that might occur during use of GLIR. I adapted standards employed by some C libraries for this. I also modified how syscalls were handled and limited use of pseudoinstructions in GLIR to allow for improved future portability. I added a structure to the repository to organize the project. I expanded the documentation of the original. This was important to ensure ease of use both for future undergrads who will be using GLIR for projects and - given the open-source nature of GLIR - for any who find the repository and wish to work with GLIR. In these ways, I kept conscious of good software practices. I hosted the documentation using Git Pages and this provided experience with writing HTML and CSS. I also added to the functionalities of GLIR by adding primitive subroutines; enabling printing of lines, triangles, and rectangles. Once the conversion of GLIR was complete, enabling use with a RISC-V simulator, I added support for using GLIR with RISC-V boards and the SiFive Freedom Studio.

                <p>During my conversion for GLIR (listed in the portfolio section) I needed a simulator which would run the project. RARS proved to be an incredible tool, yet, it lacked Unicode support - which would be required for supporting a larger range of graphical options. I approached the developer of RARS about what would be required for him to accept a Unicode support pull request.<br><br> 
                    I added Unicode encoding handling for string storage, string writing, and file writing. My changes ended up being accepted and incorporated into RARS. Implementing these features required me to learn about and understand character encoding, the Unicode format, and error catching and handling in Java. RARS is written in Java and I had no experience working with Java before this project.<br><br> 
                    I believe that my success in this project, given my lack of experience working in Java before this, demonstrates my strong computer science fundamentals. Working with the object-oriented design and error handling felt natural. Using the Java documentation to find the methods that I needed was the bulk of the work. This was my first time working on a project of this scale. RARS is a multi file project with tens of thousands of lines of code. This project afforded me excellent debugging experience, especially in tracing bugs across files and using the IntelliJ IDEA debugger.
